# IEMB-IPLF Filter
# Synopsis
This repository includes a MATLAB implementation of the Information exchange Multi-Bernoulli Filter implemented using the Iterated Posterior Linearisation Filter (IPLF), the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), the Iterated Kalman Filter (IEKF) and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF).
Also incuded is the Independant Multi-Bernoulli Filter which is implented using the IPLF and the UKF.
